# Manual Testing 
### Navigation Bar.
- For my navigation bar, I tried to use a basic nav bar design but decided to go with a version from w3schools that used javascript to make the nav bar responsive. I edited the code to change the color of the background. 
- I had to change some of the % for the linear-gradient image as the white section was undetectable. 
  Upon running the code again, I was happy with the result.

### Welcome Image.
I used an image taken from Unsplash.com.

- I found that the image was very large and I found it difficult to resize it on smaller screens, I tried to resize using media queries but this led to the image looking out of place. I changed to a different image from the same site. I found this image was very out of focus. I tried a third image that just looked too dark for the site and I felt gave it a moodier tone than I wanted. I select the image I have now. This image was brighter and brought a better atmosphere to the site.
I tried to use the same code I used for the Rome, Abruzzo and Sicily images but I found that with this image it cut the top of the image off. So I searched the internet and came up with a solution from geeks4geeks.com which helped me center the image and 
overlay text on top. 

* The contact button on the welcome image was blue. I wanted to change this to a light green to match the nav bar. It wouldn't respond at first but I found when I added "!important" to the code it changed to the desired color. 
I added the contact button in the welcome image as a qucik way to navigate to the contact form at the bottom of the page.

### Cards.
- I used cards from w3schools and edited the look and content.
- I added images  taken from unsplash and links to the wikipedia pages for each tourist attraction and for tripadvisor for the hotels.
- I found these to be responsive across all screen sizes.

### Back to top button.
- Added as a means to navigate throught the site quickly.
Taken from w3schools and edited to suit the color, size etc that I wanted.
Found to be effective.































































* W3Schools HTML/CSS validator. 
  - Picked up a few small errors eg: extra > and unclosed CSS tags in two areas.
    Fixed these issues and ran again. This returned a "Congratulations, no error found" message.
